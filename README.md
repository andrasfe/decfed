# WIP A completely decentralized Federated Learning approach

scratches for now to validate feasibility of a completely decentralized federated learning method in the presence of byzantine participants, using unbalanced data sets

currently implementing logic from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11006.pdf). Forked a [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sinjoysaha/federated-learning-mnist-cifar-10).

Initially all simple threaded, no use of tensors, until I can validate functionality.
